    <string name="http_header_field_manipulation_longdesc">This test tries to detect the presence of systems (“middle boxes”) that could be responsible for censorship or surveillance by sending HTTP requests with non-canonical headers to a backend control server. If such systems are in your network, they will likely normalize the headers or add extra headers.</string>

    <string name="risks_text_1">OONI Probe is free and open source software that enables you to examine internet censorship in your network!</string>
    <string name="risks_text_2">By running this app, you can examine whether and how websites are blocked, and whether censorship and/or surveillance systems are present in your network.</string>
    <string name="risks_text_3">You can also run this app to measure the speed and performance of your network.</string>
    <string name="risks_text_4">The data that you can collect through this app can serve as evidence of censorship events .</string>
    <string name="risks_text_5">Since OONI Probe is an investigatory tool and as such, may pose some risks.</string>
    <string name="potential_risks">Potential risks</string>
    <string name="laws_text_1">Anyone monitoring your internet activity (e.g. ISP, government, employer) can know that you are running OONI Probe (even though OONI tries to make this hard).</string>
    <string name="laws_text_2">When testing websites for censorship, you will connect to and download data from provocative or objectionable sites (e.g. pornography) that might be illegal in your country.</string>
    <string name="laws_text_3">OONI’s HTTP invalid request line test might trigger the suspicion of your ISP and could be viewed as a form of “hacking”.</string>
    <string name="laws_text_4">Unless you configure your settings otherwise, all data collected from your tests will by default be published by OONI and might include some personally- identifiable information (though OONI tries to prevent this from happening).</string>
    <string name="laws_text_5">The mere use of OONI Probe might be viewed as a form of espionage, regardless of the laws in your country.</string>
    <string name="laws_text_6">To our knowledge, no OONI Probe user has ever faced consequences from the use of our platform. However, many countries have a lengthy history of targeting and abusing digital rights activists, which could leave OONI Probe users subject to severe civil, criminal, or extra-judicial penalties.</string>
