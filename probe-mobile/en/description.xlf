        <source>OONI's Web Connectivity test is designed to examine whether access to sites is blocked through DNS tampering, TCP/IP blocking, or by a transparent HTTP proxy. By running this test, you will collect data that can serve as evidence of Internet censorship, and you will be provided with circumvention tips.</source>

        <source>OONI publishes all network measurement data that it collects because open data allows third parties to conduct independent studies, verify OONI findings and/or to answer other research questions. Such data also helps increase transparency of Internet censorship around the world. All data is published on OONI Explorer: https://explorer.ooni.torproject.org/</source>

        <source>Please note: Running ooniprobe might be against the terms of service of your ISP or legally questionable in your country. By running ooniprobe you will connect to web services which may be banned, and use web censorship circumvention methods such as Tor. The OONI project will publish data submitted by probes, possibly including your IP address or other identifying information. In addition, your use of ooniprobe will be clear to anyone who has access to your computer, and to anyone who can monitor your Internet connection (such as your employer, ISP or government).</source>
